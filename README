Simple ADC
----------
ADC is Advanced Direct Connect Protocol (a kind of successor to NMDC). Full protocol at [adc.sourceforge.net](http://adc.sourceforge.net/ADC.html).

To do
-----
(1) Create a daemon that can connect to DC Hubs. This is an intermediary.
(2) Create a client downloader program, that uses the daemon, searches stuff and downloads based on the IDs (each search result is assigned an ID).
