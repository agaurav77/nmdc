Simple ADC
----------
ADC is Advanced Direct Connect Protocol (a kind of successor to NMDC). Full protocol at http://adc.sourceforge.net/ADC.html.

To do
-----
(1) Create a daemon that can connect to DC Hubs. This is an intermediary.
(2) Create a client downloader program, that uses the daemon, searches stuff and downloads based on the IDs (each search result is assigned an ID).
(3) See the connected users and download their filelists.
